        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Am a certified primary and secondary student in schools such as St.Kaggwa Primary Sch,St.Joseph's Vocational Sch,Our Lady Of Africa SSS among others. Am currently studying a Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology at Uganda Christian University, Mukono. I am a passionate football player, which has taught me the importance of teamwork, strategy, and coordinationâ€”skills I find directly applicable to my projects in IT. I'm particularly interested in discovering how to leverage these skills to build collaborative, user-focused applications.</p>

                <h3>Airport Baggage Tracker</h3>
                <p>Passengers at many airports, including Entebbe, often experience anxiety and inconvenience due to a lack of real-time information about their luggage. This can lead to long waits and confusion.

I'm developing a simplified web application that simulates a real-time baggage tracking system. The app will allow a user to enter a unique bag ID and receive updates on its status, from check-in to arrival at the carousel.

This project will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on demonstrating my skills in data management and dynamic front-end updates.</p>

                <h3>Cineplex</h3>
                <p>Cinemas today often involve long queues for tickets, limited information on available showtimes, and an outdated booking process. This creates inconvenience for moviegoers and inefficiencies for the cinemas.

I'm developing a user-friendly web application to streamline the entire movie-going experience. The app will provide a real-time weekly schedule of movies, allow users to select their preferred showtime, and enable a seamless seat selection and booking process. The system aims to empower users to book their tickets from the comfort of their homes, eliminating the need to wait in line.

This project will be built using HTML for structure, CSS for a modern and intuitive design, and JavaScript for all the core functionality. I am using JavaScript to handle data management (for movies, showtimes, and booked seats), user interaction, and dynamic content generation.</p>
